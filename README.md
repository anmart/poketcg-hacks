# Pokemon TCG Hacks
This is a collection of all the hacks I've created using the pret disassembly of [pokemon TCG](https://github.com/pret/poketcg). This repo will fall behind pret's, only pulling when I want to work on a new hack.

Every hack is set up as a branch of this repo, with _patch\__ as a prefix


## Included Hacks

* [Card Loss Challenge](https://github.com/anmart/poketcg-hacks/tree/patch_CardLossChallenge)
  * First time trying custom menus!
  * Removes cards from your deck after every battle and gives extra booster packs to make up for it

### Pokémon TCG

This is a disassembly of Pokémon TCG.

It builds the following rom:

- Pokémon Trading Card Game (U) [C][!].gbc `sha1: 0f8670a583255cff3e5b7ca71b5d7454d928fc48`

To assemble, first download RGBDS (https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/releases) and extract it to /usr/local/bin.
Run `make` in your shell.

This will output a file named "poketcg.gbc".
